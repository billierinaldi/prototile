**prototile** creates self-similar substitution tilings based on multicolored square tiles.  At each iteration, each square of the existing tiling is replaced by a set of squares based on the color of the original square.  For iteration 0, an initial set of squares must be specified.

Additional information about substitution tilings can be found on Wikipedia's [substitution tiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_tiling) page and on [Natalie Priebe Frank's home page](http://math.vassar.edu/Faculty/Frank/default.html), which also features a Matlab-based relative of **prototile**.

See the [Instructions](Instructions.md) to find out how to get started with **prototile**.  It may also be useful to see some [Examples](Examples.md).
