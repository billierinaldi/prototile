## Creating a Tiling ##
A tip for making an interesting-looking display is to set the _Color 1_ Tile to be the inverse of the _Color 0_ Tile.  In the following picture, the 3 x 3 _Color 0_ Tile is all white with a single black square in the middle, and the _Color 1_ Tile is all black with a single white square in the middle.  Try setting yours the same way.  You will need to set _Tile Size_ to 3 to get 3 x 3 Tiles.  Your _Display_ still doesn't look the same as the picture, right?  That is because the _Square Size_ and the _Iterations_ have also been adjusted.  _Square Size_ controls the width in pixels of the Squares in the _Display_ window.  _Iterations_ controls how many times the Tiles are substituted in for the Squares in the _Display_.  Experiment with these parameters until you get a feel for how they work.

## Sliding a Tiling ##
Now click the _Slide_ box.  This draws two copies of the _Display_ tiling.  You can slide one copy over the other by moving the mouse.  If you find an offset you like, you can click the mouse once to freeze the copy in place.  Clicking again allows you to resume sliding.  You can find large-scale patterns by picking good offsets.  To make it easier to align the pictures on the boundaries of the squares, you can click the _Snap to Squares_ box.

## Rotating a Tiling ##
While _Slide_ is enabled, you can also rotate the tiling by clicking and dragging in the _Display_ window.  Sliding is paused when you start a rotation, but you can click the mouse once to resume sliding.  Double clicking will reset the rotation.

## Animating a Tiling ##
If you click on the _Animate_ tabe in the _Prototile_ window, you will see animation settings.  Animation can be used to cycle through a number of precise offsets quickly to find interesting ones.  If you see one you like, you can pause the animation.  You can step the animation forward or backward while paused.
