# prototile-js

Prototile generates self-similar substitution tilings based on squares of
different colors.  At each iteration, each square of the existing tiling is
replaced by a set of squares based on the color of the original square.  For
iteration 0, an initial set of squares must be specified.

Additional information about substitution tilings can be found on
[Wikipedia][1] and on Dr. Natalie Priebe Frank's [tiling page][2], which also
features a Matlab-based relative of Prototile.
